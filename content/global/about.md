My name is Marc Helbling. I’m a software engineer with a Ph.D thesis (“[Virtual sculpture using particles system](http://www.theses.fr/2010ISAM0030)”). I’ve been an early stage contributor in [some](http://tinyclues.com) [successful](http://captaintrain.com) [startups](http://sketchfab.com) and [scale-ups](https://algolia.com). I have served as a CTO at an [early stage ecommerce platform](https://la-tournee.co) and an Engineering Manager at a [deep tech company](https://aqemia.com).

I am mostly interested in building efficient teams and systems, with a special ❤️when they deal with vertices and polygons.
